            <h1>Face of Melinda</h1>
            <h2>Opeth</h2>
            <p> By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
                The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
                No joy would flicker in her eyes
                Brooding sadness came to a rise
            </p>
            <p> Words would falter to atone
                Failure had passed the stepping stone
                She had sworn her vows to another
                This is when no-one will bother
            </p>
            <p>And conceded pain in crumbling mirth
                A harlot of God upon the earth
                Found where she sacrificed her ways
                That hollow love in her face
            </p>
            <p>
                Still I plotted to have her back
                The contentment that would fill the crack
                My soul released a fluttering sigh
                This day fell, the darkness nigh
            </p>
            <p>
                I took her by the hand to say
                All faith forever has been washed away
                I returned for you in great dismay
                Come with me, far away to stay
            </p>
            <p>
                Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
                She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
                But baffled herself with the final line
                My promise is made but my heart is thine
            </p>
