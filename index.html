                <h1>Face of Melinda</h1>
                <h2>Opeth</h2>
                <p> 
                By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair<br>
                The face of Melinda neath blackened hair<br>
                No joy would flicker in her eyes<br>
                Brooding sadness came to a rise<br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                Words would falter to atone<br>
                Failure had passed the stepping stone<br>
                She had sworn her vows to another<br>
                This is when no-one will bother<br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                And conceded pain in crumbling mirth<br>
                A harlot of God upon the earth<br>
                Found where she sacrificed her ways<br>
                That hollow love in her face<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Still I plotted to have her back<br>
                The contentment that would fill the crack<br>
                My soul released a fluttering sigh<br>
                This day fell, the darkness nigh<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                I took her by the hand to say<br>
                All faith forever has been washed away<br>
                I returned for you in great dismay<br>
                Come with me, far away to stay<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime<br>
                She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme<br>
                But baffled herself with the final line<br>
                My promise is made but my heart is thine<br>   
                </p>
